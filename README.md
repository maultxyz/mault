# Magic Vault

A TCG card scanner and physical sorter. A webcam identifies cards via AI image embeddings, a rule engine decides which bin each card belongs in, and a feeder and servo mechanism driven by an Arduino or ESP32 physically routes the card there.

## Supported TCGs

Magic: The Gathering, Pokemon, Yu-Gi-Oh, One Piece, Lorcana, Gundam, Flesh and Blood, Riftbound

## How it works

1. A feeder mechanism (continuous-rotation servo + roller) pulls a card from the hopper into view of the webcam, into a fixed, per-camera-calibrated scan region (see calibration screen) used as a coarse hint for step 2
2. The browser locates the card's four corners and perspective-dewarps it to a straightened crop, then embeds it, all client-side via [CollectorVision](https://github.com/HanClinto/CollectorVision)'s Cornelius (corner detection) and Milo (embedding) ONNX models running in-browser
3. The embedding is sent to the server for similarity search (or, if the client can't run the on-device models, the raw image is sent for server-side embedding instead)
4. PostgreSQL vector similarity search (pgvector) identifies the card
5. Configurable, per-collection bin rules decide which bin the card should go to
6. The web app sends a serial command to the microcontroller, which drives the trapdoor/paddle/pusher servos to route the card into that bin

## Features

- Live webcam scanning with automatic card detection and identification; captures wait for the card to physically settle at the sensor before the shot is taken
- Multi-TCG support: pluggable card-search adapters per game, with each game's own admin-configurable field definitions driving sorting, filtering, and bin rules
- Rule-based sort bins, grouped by collection, with and/or rule trees across each game's own card fields (color, rarity, price, set, etc.)
- Override rules let a matching bin take priority over ordinary bins. For example, enable **Override rules** on bin 6 with a price condition of **greater than or equal to 1** to send cards worth $1+ there before checking color bins 1–5. If multiple override bins match, the lowest bin number wins; unmatched cards still use the catch-all.
- Card grid sorting (by name, price, rarity, etc.) adapts automatically to whichever game a collection uses
- Multiple collections per organization, each with their own bin configuration and card history
- Remote monitoring: watch an in-progress scan session live from another device
- Discord bot: link a Discord server to an organization with `/link` and a code from the Integrations page, then anyone in it can run `/stats` (optionally scoped to one collection via autocomplete) to check collection stats. Everything else is set up in the app's Integrations page: which channels get every scan and every error or alert (server-wide or per collection), and notification rules that post matching cards to their own channels. No webhook URLs to configure
- Per-organization branding and scanner layout settings
- Feeder, servo, and camera scan-region calibration tools: the camera's capture region can be dragged/resized live against the feed to match different webcam mountings and fields of view
- In-app hardware build guide (`/build`) with bill of materials, wiring diagrams, and assembly instructions

## Stack

- **Web**: React 19, Vite, React Router v7, Tailwind CSS 4, TanStack Query
- **Server**: Hono 4, Drizzle ORM, PostgreSQL (pgvector) — either Neon-hosted or self-hosted
- **Auth**: two interchangeable providers, picked with `AUTH_PROVIDER` — [Neon Auth](https://neon.com) (JWT, hosted) or [own-auth](https://own-auth.com) (self-hosted, bearer tokens against your own Postgres); see [Choosing a provider](#choosing-a-provider)
- **Hardware**: Arduino Uno R4 or ESP32 via Web Serial API (9600 baud), PCA9685 servo driver
- **Monorepo**: Turborepo + pnpm workspaces

## Getting started

### Choosing a provider

The app needs a Postgres database with pgvector (for card-embedding search) and an identity provider (for login + row-level security), selected by `AUTH_PROVIDER`/`VITE_AUTH_PROVIDER`:

- **`neon`** (default) — a hosted [Neon](https://neon.com) project. A few minutes of console setup, then `pnpm dev`. Neon's free tier is enough for a personal/single-org deployment.
- **`local`** — fully self-hosted, no external account, works offline. `docker-compose.yml` runs the whole stack (Postgres+pgvector, API, web app) with [own-auth](https://own-auth.com) handling sign-up/sign-in against that same self-hosted Postgres.

Both providers read from the same root `.env` (Vite is configured to read up from `packages/web`, so there's no separate `packages/web/.env`):

```bash
cp .env.neon.example .env      # Option A: Neon
cp .env.docker.example .env    # Option B: self-hosted
```

Each file holds only the variables its provider uses, with `AUTH_PROVIDER`/`VITE_AUTH_PROVIDER` already set.

### Option A: Neon

1. Create a Neon project at [console.neon.tech](https://console.neon.tech) (any recent Postgres version works; pgvector ships as a bundled extension).
2. Open the SQL editor on your project's default branch/database and enable pgvector:
   ```sql
   CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;
   ```
3. Copy the pooled connection string (Dashboard → Connect) into `DATABASE_URL`.
4. Enable **Neon Auth** for the project (Dashboard → Auth). This provisions the `auth` schema, the `authenticated` Postgres role, and `auth.user_id()` — the row-level-security policies in `drizzle/*.sql` reference these directly, so Auth must be enabled _before_ you run migrations or `db:push` (step below), or they'll fail with an undefined function/role error.
5. From the Auth page, grab:
   - `NEON_AUTH_URL` — the base Auth URL (the server derives the JWKS endpoint and JWT issuer from it: `${NEON_AUTH_URL}/.well-known/jwks.json`)
   - `VITE_NEON_AUTH_URL` — same Auth base URL, used client-side by the Better Auth React client
   - `VITE_NEON_DATA_API_URL` — the project's Data API URL, also from the Auth page
6. Run `pnpm --filter @magic-vault/server db:push` (or `db:generate` + `db:migrate`, see [Database](#database)) to create the schema and RLS policies against your new database.
7. Install and run:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   pnpm dev        # Vite on :5173, Hono on :3001
   ```

### Option B: Self-hosted (no Neon account, works offline)

1. In `.env` (copied from `.env.docker.example`), fill in:
   - `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` — the local Postgres container's password
   - `OWN_AUTH_TOKEN_PEPPER` — 32+ random bytes; own-auth uses it to hash sessions/tokens/API keys
   - `IMPERSONATION_SECRET` — any random string
   - `MONITOR_LINK_SECRET` — any random string (optional; enables shareable no-login monitor links)
   - `API_URL`: the API server's public base URL, e.g. `https://mault.example.com/api` (optional; used for `next_page` links in the public API, which otherwise come from the request's host)
   - `WEBHOOK_ALLOW_INSECURE_URLS`: `true` lets webhooks use `http://` and private addresses such as LAN or `localhost` targets (optional; off by default, keep it off on any server reachable from the internet)
2. Start the stack:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```
3. Open `http://localhost:8080` and sign up. The first account ever created on a fresh instance is automatically made platform admin (Games Manager, sync job, impersonation) and gets a default "Home" organisation — from there, add at least one game in the admin Games Manager (`/app/admin`) and run its sync before scanning, or collections/scanning have nothing to match against.

Prices (TCGplayer USD and Cardmarket EUR) come from the `prices` container, which starts with the stack, pulls on start and then checks every `PRICE_SYNC_INTERVAL_HOURS` (6 by default), only downloading what changed upstream. Prices attach to synced cards, so run a game's sync from `/app/admin` first; until then, or until the first pull finishes, cards show no price. Watch it with `docker compose logs -f prices`, or force a full re-pull with `docker compose exec prices node packages/server/dist/scripts/sync-prices.js --force`.

The `server` container applies Drizzle migrations, own-auth's own migrations, and the RLS bootstrap (`packages/server/src/db/bootstrap-local.sql`, run via `pnpm db:migrate-local` — see that script for why plain Postgres needs a few things Neon normally provisions automatically) on every start; all three steps are idempotent.

To grant a _second_ admin, update their row in `platform_user_roles` directly — there's no UI for it yet:

```sql
INSERT INTO platform_user_roles (user_id, role) VALUES ('<their own_auth_users.id>', 'admin')
ON CONFLICT (user_id) DO UPDATE SET role = 'admin';
```

Local mode covers sign-up/sign-in/sign-out/session/org-switch, its own org invite UI, personal API keys, and an org audit log — email verification, profile/password editing, and multi-device session management stay Neon-only for now (see `CLAUDE.md`'s Auth & RLS section).

## Database

```bash
pnpm --filter @magic-vault/server db:generate  # generate a migration from schema changes
pnpm --filter @magic-vault/server db:migrate   # apply migrations
pnpm --filter @magic-vault/server db:push      # push schema directly (dev)
pnpm --filter @magic-vault/server db:studio    # open Drizzle Studio
```

These target whichever Postgres `DATABASE_URL` points at. Self-hosted mode's container applies migrations automatically (see [Option B](#option-b-self-hosted-no-neon-account-works-offline)) — you only need these commands by hand against Neon, or after changing `packages/server/src/db/schema.ts`.

## Deployment

`Dockerfile.server` builds the Hono API (and pre-downloads the pinned CollectorVision Milo model at build time — `packages/server/src/lib/models/model-registry.ts`). `Dockerfile.web` builds the Vite SPA and serves it with nginx (`nginx.conf`); `VITE_API_URL` (and `VITE_AUTH_PROVIDER`) must be supplied as build args since they're baked into the client bundle. `Dockerfile.bot` builds the optional Discord bot — it talks to the server over HTTP (`SERVER_URL`), never the database directly, but the connection is bidirectional: the server also calls back into the bot's own small HTTP server (`BOT_PORT`, exposed to the server as `BOT_URL`) to post every notification into whichever channel was set with `/notify-channel` (errors, jams, sync failures) or `/scan-channel` (card scans), or for Buy Me a Coffee donations (`routes/public.ts`'s `/webhooks/buymeacoffee`, unauthenticated but HMAC-verified rather than org-linked). Both directions share `BOT_API_SECRET`.

> If you're running a Pi-hole or similar DNS-level blocker on your network, it may block `huggingface.co`, which will cause the Milo model download to fail. Allowlist that domain if you hit download errors during the server build/startup.

### Deploying self-hosted

The same `docker compose up -d` flow from [Option B](#option-b-self-hosted-no-neon-account-works-offline) is the production deployment too — just point `WEB_URL` at your public URL, and use a real `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`/`OWN_AUTH_TOKEN_PEPPER`/`IMPERSONATION_SECRET` rather than dev placeholders.

```bash
docker compose up --build -d              # server + web + price sync + local Postgres
docker compose --profile bot up --build -d  # + Discord bot
```

Inside compose the server and bot reach each other by service name (`http://server:3001`, `http://bot:3002`), so the `SERVER_URL`/`BOT_URL` values in `.env` (which point at localhost for `pnpm dev`) are overridden there. If you already run `sync-prices` from your own scheduler, set `PRICE_SYNC_INTERVAL_HOURS=0` so the `prices` container doesn't pull too.

### Deploying with Neon

For the Neon-backed deployment (`AUTH_PROVIDER=neon`, the default), the database and auth still need a [Neon project](#option-a-neon) set up first, and its connection details passed to the server container as env vars (`DATABASE_URL`, `NEON_AUTH_URL`, `WEB_URL`) and to the web build as build args (`VITE_API_URL`, `VITE_NEON_AUTH_URL`, `VITE_NEON_DATA_API_URL`, `VITE_APP_ENV`, `VITE_LATEST_FIRMWARE_VERSION`). A minimal setup:

```bash
docker build -f Dockerfile.server -t magic-vault-server .
docker run -p 3001:3001 --env-file .env magic-vault-server

docker build -f Dockerfile.web \
  --build-arg VITE_API_URL=https://your-api-host \
  --build-arg VITE_NEON_AUTH_URL=$VITE_NEON_AUTH_URL \
  --build-arg VITE_NEON_DATA_API_URL=$VITE_NEON_DATA_API_URL \
  --build-arg VITE_APP_ENV=production \
  --build-arg VITE_LATEST_FIRMWARE_VERSION=1.0.2 \
  -t magic-vault-web .
docker run -p 8080:80 magic-vault-web
```

Point `WEB_URL` (server env) at the public URL of the web container so CORS and Discord monitor-page links resolve correctly, and re-run `db:push`/`db:migrate` against the Neon database as part of your deploy if the schema changed.

The same `docker-compose.yml` from [Option B](#option-b-self-hosted-no-neon-account-works-offline) can wire the three images together this way too (server on :3001, web on :8080, and the optional bot on :3002) — `AUTH_PROVIDER` in `.env` just needs to be `neon` (the default) rather than `local`:

```bash
docker compose up --build
docker compose --profile bot up --build  # + Discord bot
```

`.env` must already point `DATABASE_URL`/`NEON_AUTH_URL` at a real Neon project — the `postgres` service in `docker-compose.yml` still starts alongside it, but sits unused since nothing points at it in this mode.

## Hardware

The full bill of materials, wiring diagrams, and assembly instructions live in the app at `/build`. In short:

- Arduino Uno R4 or ESP32 Dev Module, driving a PCA9685 servo controller over I2C
- 3 positional SG90 servos per sorting module (trapdoor, paddle gate, pusher) plus 1 continuous-rotation SG90 for the feeder — module count is configurable (up to 5 on a single PCA9685) in Calibration
- IR sensor for card-feed detection
- Enclosure and module parts are in `3d model/` (Fusion 360 source + printable `.3mf`)

Upload `firmware/main/main.ino` (requires the ArduinoJson library) to either board via the Arduino IDE — see `/build` for the full flashing steps and per-board pin/wiring differences. The sketch is always compiled for the full module ceiling a single PCA9685 supports — it doesn't need to match how many modules you've actually built, since the app already knows each org's real module count and only ever sends route commands for modules that exist, so you can add modules later without reflashing. It communicates via JSON over USB serial: the web app sends `{"route": {"module": N, "direction": "left"|"right"|"bottom"}}`, resolved from the bin's routing assignment in Calibration, and the board runs the routing sequence. `"bottom"` advances the card through each preceding module (same as `"left"`/`"right"`) and drops it through the target module's own bottom output, rather than a shared catch-all — any bin can be assigned to any module's bottom output.

Where module 1 starts on the PCA9685 is also runtime-configurable, not baked into the firmware: a "PCA9685 channel layout" toggle in Calibration (Standard = channel 0, up to 5 modules; Legacy = channel 4, reserving 0-3 for the status LEDs older firmware drove, up to 3 modules) sends `{"setChannelOffset": N}` once per connection. Orgs with pre-existing module calibration data default to Legacy so already-wired hardware keeps working unchanged; new orgs default to Standard.
