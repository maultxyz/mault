-- Bootstrap DDL for AUTH_PROVIDER=local deployments only.
--
-- Neon provisions the `authenticated` Postgres role and the
-- `auth_is_org_member()` function automatically when Neon Auth is enabled on a
-- project, and its `pg_session_jwt` extension maps `request.jwt.claims` to that
-- role at the connection level. A plain Postgres/pgvector container has none of
-- that, so this script recreates the pieces the app's RLS policies
-- (drizzle-orm/neon/rls's crudPolicy, see db/schema.ts) depend on: the role
-- itself (db/index.ts issues `SET LOCAL ROLE authenticated` after setting the
-- claim, in local mode only) and an `auth_is_org_member` with the same name and
-- signature Neon's version has, backed by own-auth's own membership table
-- instead of `neon_auth.member`.
--
-- Neon's neon_auth.* tables live in a separate `neon_auth` schema, so its
-- equivalent role provisioning never touches them. own-auth has no per-schema
-- config and puts its own_auth_* tables (sessions, password hashes, API keys)
-- in this same `public` schema, so grants here are listed per-table rather
-- than schema-wide - "GRANT ... ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public" would also
-- hand the authenticated role table-level access to those. Add a table name
-- to the relevant array below whenever one is added to db/schema.ts.
--
-- Idempotent, and safe to run before the tables below exist (each GRANT is
-- skipped via a to_regclass() check rather than erroring) - scripts/
-- migrate-local.ts runs this file after Drizzle migrations create those
-- tables, but the role/extension/function need to exist even earlier, before
-- Drizzle's own migration runs (its RLS policies reference both by name), so
-- it also applies those three ahead of Drizzle - see that file for the why.
